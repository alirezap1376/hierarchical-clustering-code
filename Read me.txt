In this section, I have written the code related to the algorithm without using its specific libraries, 
so there is room for its possible development.  
In the dictionary called 'newD', the order of grouping of elements is shown, 
and if the decision maker has a specific number of clusters in mind, in Dataframe 'firstdataframe', 
the number of clusters specified by the decision maker is created, and its members are shown.
